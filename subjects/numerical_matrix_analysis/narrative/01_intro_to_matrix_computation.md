# Chapter 1: Introduction to Matrix Computation

Numerical matrix analysis studies algorithms for solving problems involving matrices:
- solving linear systems
- factorizing matrices
- computing eigenvalues and singular values
- approximating functions of matrices

## Why Numerical Matrix Analysis Matters
Matrix computations form the backbone of:
- scientific computing
- optimization
- machine learning
- signal processing
- PDE solvers
- graph analysis

## Key Questions
- How do floating-point errors propagate?
- How stable is an algorithm?
- How well-conditioned is a problem?
- How do we compute large-scale eigenvalues?

This chapter introduces the motivation and provides the roadmap for the remaining chapters.
