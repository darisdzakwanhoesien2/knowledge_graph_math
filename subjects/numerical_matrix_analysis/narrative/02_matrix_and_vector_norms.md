# Chapter 2: Vector and Matrix Norms

Norms measure the size of vectors and matrices and form the mathematical foundation of error bounds and conditioning.

## Vector Norms
Covers:
- p-norms
- equivalence of norms
- geometric intuition

## Matrix Norms
Includes:
- induced norms
- spectral norm
- Frobenius norm

These tools appear throughout all numerical algorithms.
